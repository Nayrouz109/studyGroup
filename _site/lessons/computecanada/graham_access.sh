# Large jobs, especially those requiring inter-node communication, will be considerably faster in scratch space
# Scratch space is only backed up for 6 months, but nothing there will be deleted without you being informed
# and your memory allocation for it will be much larger, so it's a good place to keep in-progress files

# Install R package globally from CRAN (actually works):

module load gcc/5.4.0
module load r/3.4.3

R

install.packages("package_name")

# Should prompt you to choose which CRAN. Take your pick.
# Not sure how to access these packages in your R script. 

library("package_name") 

# will ideally work.

# Install R package locally
# First scp tar.gz file to a good place in Cedar/Graham
# From within that folder call:

module load r/3.4.3

R

install.packages("package_name", repos = NULL, lib = "/home/path/to/library" )
