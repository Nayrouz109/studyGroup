# Overview
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** *button* a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




## Adding code chunk

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

data("mtcars")

dim(mtcars)

glimpse(mtcars)
```


## Holding results
```{r, results = "hold"}
```


```{r, results = "hold"}
data("mtcars")

dim(mtcars)

glimpse(mtcars)
```


## Making a nice table
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  filter(mpg > 20) %>% 
  rownames_to_column("car") %>% 
  kable()
```


# Making a plot

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(4, 6, 8)) +
  labs(x = "No. Cylinders", y = "Miles per Gallon") +
  theme_classic()
```
