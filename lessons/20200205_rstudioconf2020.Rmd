- 2 days of workshops
- 2 days of conference talks

## Birds of a Feather

- ability to connect with people with the same interests
- ie. RLadies, Artists, Spatial, Education, Academia, Finance, Healthcare

## 4 different tracks
- geared toward different skill levels
- I feel like it would be most beneficial if you had some experience with using a lot of the packages in the tidyverse 
- amazing talks that are all live streamed
- included remote participants in online Q&A

## Highlights
- I went to a lot of talks on visualization , design , community, education and workflow related
- Still need to catch up on talks I couldn’t go to

## Day 1 Keynotes

</center>
- main big announcement
- rstudio is now a certified B corp `r emo::ji("tada")`

## Education
- ![](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/images/00_narrative/Fireside.jpg){width=500px}
- [Of Teacups, Giraffes, & R Markdown](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/)
- lovely visual journey of the design process
- almost like a picture book

## Community
- [If You Build It, They Will Come...But Then What? Facilitating Communities Of Practice In R](https://www.slideshare.net/katehertweck/if-you-build-it-they-will-comebut-then-what-facilitating-communities-of-practice-in-r)
- gives me perspective on organizing coding groups
- even people who are doing this as their job struggle to get groups together

## Learning and Using R
- [Learning R With Humorous Side Projects](http://www.ryantimpe.com/rstudio2020.pdf)
- the highlight of all the talks for me!
- using lego -`library(brickr)`, tv shows and dinosaurs to motivate R learning
- helped him get his current job at Lego!

## Day 2 Keynotes
- Jenny Bryan’s [object closure not subsettable](https://github.com/jennybc/debugging#readme)
- `r emo::ji("computer") `name based upon the common but confusing R error message
- useful talk on debugging for all skill levels
- one of the live polls was "What's your main debugging method"
- majority by a landslide: **"Google is my BFF"**

## Communicate
- [Don’t Repeat Yourself, Talk To Yourself! Repeated Reporting In The R Universe](https://sharstudioconf.netlify.com/#1)
- Nice to see other attempts at streamlining a workflow containing emails, SPSS, Excel, Word
- Although R is great for a lot of things but we really need:
- Clear names, good templates and package documentation to make it all work

## ggplot2
- [Spruce Up Your Ggplot2 Visualizations With Formatted Text](https://www.slideshare.net/ClausWilke/spruce-up-your-ggplot2-visualizations-with-formatted-text)
- with `library(ggtext)`
- `r emo::ji("clap")` you can now easily use *italics* in ggplots
- `r emo::ji("clap")` **coloured** text can be easily added to ggplots
- `r emo::ji("clap")` **images** can be easily integrated into ggplots
- all simple things but makes our lives so much easier
- *note* not available on CRAN yet...

## Concluding thoughts
- Great conference for all individuals from various background
- Really great for getting exposed to new packages and connect with the community in person
- Welcoming atmosphere facilitated by the organizing team

## But what everyone is actually there for...
