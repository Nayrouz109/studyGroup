## For Participants

Welcome to our Mozilla Study Group! A few things to do & know now that you're here:

 - **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).
 - **Check out the issue tracker:** click on 'issues' in the sidebar on the right; this is where all the conversations this study groups is having live. Use this space to ask questions, request events, make suggestions, or just say hi.
 - **Read the code of conduct:** this Study Group is for everyone - we abide by a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
 - **Add yourself to the website:** If you'd like to appear on the website under the 'Who we Are' section, have a look at the `_data/members.yml`; send us a pull request with an entry for yourself, or open an issue and we'll do it for you. Basically, we need the following information:


```
- name: your human name
  affiliation: school, lab, department, business....
  github: your GitHub handle
  interests:
    - list one to three
    - different interests
```
