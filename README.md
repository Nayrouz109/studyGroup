Vancouver R Study Group
=======================

Welcome to the Vancouver R Study Group! We are a group of **R/Python/Julia/(insert your favourite language)** enthusiasts who love data. We are an inclusive group and welcome everyone. Check out our [event listings on our website](http://ubc-r-study-group.github.io/studyGroup/), or join the conversation on our [message board](https://github.com/ubc-r-study-group/studyGroup/issues).

## For Participants

Welcome to our Mozilla Study Group! A few things to do & know now that you're here:

 - **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).
 - **Check out the issue tracker:** click on 'issues' in the sidebar on the right; this is where all the conversations this study groups is having live. Use this space to ask questions, request events, make suggestions, or just say hi.
 - **Read the code of conduct:** this Study Group is for everyone - we abide by a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
 - **Add yourself to the website:** If you'd like to appear on the website under the 'Who we Are' section, have a look at the `_data/members.yml`; send us a pull request with an entry for yourself, or open an issue and we'll do it for you. Basically, we need the following information:


```
- name: your human name
  affiliation: school, lab, department, business....
  github: your GitHub handle
  interests:
    - list one to three
    - different interests
```


### Wait What's a 'Mozilla Study Group'?

Mozilla Study Groups are fun, informal meetups of your friends and colleagues from around your local institution or town to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers.
