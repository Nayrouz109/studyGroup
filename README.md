Vancouver R Study Group
=======================

Welcome to the Vancouver R Study Group! We are a group of **R/Python/Julia/(insert your favourite language)** enthusiasts who love data. We are an inclusive group and welcome everyone. Check out our [event listings on our website](http://ubc-r-study-group.github.io/studyGroup/), or join the conversation on our [message board](https://github.com/ubc-r-study-group/studyGroup/issues).

## Intro R Workshop - NEW DATE - OCTOBER 4th, 2019
Are you interested in learning R, but don't know where to start? In this workshop, you will code along with us as we show you how to wrangle your large and messy data frames, generate simple summary statistics, and make beautiful plots. We will have coffee and snacks too! Register at the [link](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/r-beginner-workshop-tickets-68936650377)!
