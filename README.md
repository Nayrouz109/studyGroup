UBC R Study Group
=======================

Welcome to the UBC R Study Group! We are a group of **R/Python/Julia/(insert your favourite language)** enthusiasts who love data. We are an inclusive group and welcome everyone. Check out our [event listings on our website](http://ubc-r-study-group.github.io/studyGroup/), or join the conversation on our [message board](https://github.com/ubc-r-study-group/studyGroup/issues). Our regular Wednesday sessions are totally open; no sign-up, registration or fee is required to attend. 

## Schedule
Come join us on **Wednesdays 1-2pm at Koerner Library Room 548/552.**

Here's our tentative schedule for the semester. This might not be the most up-to-date; for that, please check the issues.

We will also be continuing the study group come the new year; our Winter 2020 schedule will be posted here. 

**We are already looking for people to lead our sessions!** Drop us a line at ubcrstudygroup@gmail.com or come to one of our sessions to connect if you are interested in teaching one of the lessons.

## What's a Work-A-Long session?
These sessions are meant as an opportunity for you to come and ask questions or get help with a programming problem. Bring your code or data and get adive or tips, and chat with your fellow peers. Just like our other sessions, these are totally open, no registration needed. 

## For Participants
Welcome to our Mozilla Study Group! A few things to do & know now that you're here:

 - **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).
 - **Check out the issue tracker:** click on 'issues' in the sidebar on the right; this is where all the conversations this study groups is having live. Use this space to ask questions, request events, make suggestions, or just say hi.
 - **Read the code of conduct:** this Study Group is for everyone - we abide by a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
 - **Add yourself to the website:** If you'd like to appear on the website under the 'Who we Are' section, have a look at the `_data/members.yml`; send us a pull request with an entry for yourself, or open an issue and we'll do it for you. Basically, we need the following information:


```
- name: your human name
  affiliation: school, lab, department, business....
  github: your GitHub handle
  interests:
    - list one to three
    - different interests
```
